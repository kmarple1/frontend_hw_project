## Pixel Perfection

I strive to match the designs I'm given down to the pixel. In this case, there are only two remaining issues. First, I wasn't able to figure out which font you were using, so there are minor differences there. Second, there's a little bit of stretching in the sign. The latter is actually a design choice, as the sizes for my project were chosen to avoid stretching or scaling the provided images, but it would be easy enough to fix. Below are overlays of my project with the provided mock images:

Overlay with Mock_1.png:
![Mock 1 Overlay](./mock1-overlay.png "Mock")

Overlay with Mock_2.png
![Mock 2 Overlay](./mock2-overlay.png "Mock2")
